For this project I focused on creating modular and well documented code to ensure it was maintainable, readable and adaptable. The CRUD python module encapsulated all the core database operations (create, read, update and delete). This design allowed me to reuse the module across different parts of the project to connect the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database. In the future the module could be extended and reused in web applications that require interaction with similar datasets.
To approach problems like this, I follow a structured and iterative process. I begin by analyzing the client's requirements and then design a system that meets those needs through flexible data queries and visualizations. While this was not my first experience working on real world applications, this project gave me valuable exposure to integrating data logic and user interaction through a dashboard interface. For the future, I plan to continue using strategies like modular CRUD systems, data visualization and client focused design. 
As a computer scientist, the ability to create tools like this matters because it allows organizations to make informed, data driven decisions helping them achieve their goals more effectively and with greater impact.
